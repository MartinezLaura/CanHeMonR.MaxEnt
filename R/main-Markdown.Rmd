##Sampling presence and pseudo-absent data for maxent
Function that creates a sample dataframe for the selected classes with the presences and background points for the selected rasters. This sample will be used as training data for image classification through MaxEnt

#####Inputs

+ Points shapefile with the presence data.
+ Path to the rasters and the associated textures of the area that we want to predict. It is important to add all the areas that we want to predict and not only a sample of it in order to help the model describe the variation of the data.
+ A vector with the classes that we want to model. this vector has to have the same fields as the ones described on the shapefile
+ An integer describing the number of background points that we want to sample for each tile

<em>More information and examples of the function in the code</em>

#####Output
+ Serialized object (rdsdata file) with the data frame with the presences and absences points of the selected classes

#####Function
You can set the parameters and run it in the R console with:  
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
render("sample_points.r", params = list(r_train_dir= "" ,
                                        text_train_dir= "",
                                        tile= "",

                                        field_name= "",
                                        nimputs_tile="",
                                        data_outp_dir="",
                                        abs_samp= "",
                                        parallel= "",
                                        nWorkers= "",
                                        data_outp_name= "",
                                        randompt= ""))

```


##Calibrate and creation of the MaxEnt model
Calibration and creation of the model for each class selected in the previous step, using a raster brick as predictors. If desired, it can output also the stadisctics of the model to measure the preformace.

#####Inputs

+ A vector with the classes that we want to model. this vector has to have the same fields as the ones described in the previus function
+ Serialized object (rdsdata file) with the data frame with the presences and absences points of the selected classes

<em>More information and examples of the function in the code</em>


#####Output
+ Serialized object (rdsdata file) with class-specific distribution MaxEnt models

#####Function
You can set the parameters and run it in the R console with:  
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
render("calibrate_model.r", params = list(vuln_classes = "", 
                                          training_path = "", 
                                          model_outp_dir = "", 
                                          name = "",
                                          stadistics = "", 
                                          myargs = "", 
                                          model_type = "",
                                          stadisticspath = ""))

```

##Run model
Run a saved MaxEnt model on the image data you want to predict.

#####Inputs
+ Path to the rasters and the associated textures of the area that we want to predict. It is important to add all the areas that we want to predict and not only a sample of it in order to help the model describe the variation of the data.
+ Serialized object (rdsdata file) with the MaxEnt model you want to use

<em>More information and examples of the function in the code</em>


#####Output
+ A raster image for each tile with the probabilities or cummulative probabilities of presence for each class

#####Function
You can set the parameters and run it in the R console with:  
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
render("run_model.r", params = list(predictor_dir = "",
                                         text_train_dir = "",
                                         MaxEntmodel_dir = "",
                                         fname_MaxEntmodel_r = "",
                                         output_dir = "",
                                         rastername = "",
                                         model_type = "",
                                         loop = ""))

```


##Selection of the threshold and poligonization of the raster
Creation of several serialized objects with different thresholds in order to select the one that maximized the retrival of Pine trees with the less false positive possible
Selection of the smallest number of pixels detected inside a true tree-disk.
Poligonization of the raster files.

#####Inputs
There are several inputs because three functions are executed in this step, therefore is better to access directily to the specific functions

<em>More information and examples of the function in the code</em>


#####Output
+ A shapefile based on the information of the raster image outputed by MaxEnt given a cutoff

#####Function
In this case three functions have to be executed
You can set the parameters and run it in the R console with:  
```{r, eval=F, echo=T}
render("run_model.r", params = list(predictor_dir = "",
                                         text_train_dir = "",
                                         MaxEntmodel_dir = "",
                                         fname_MaxEntmodel_r = "",
                                         output_dir = "",
                                         rastername = "",
                                         model_type = "",
                                         loop = ""))

```
